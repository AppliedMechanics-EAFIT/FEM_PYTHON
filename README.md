2D-Finite Element Analysis with Python
This repo contains a simple finite element analysis code for 2D elasticity problems. The code uses as input data simple-to-create text files containing nodal, element, material and load data. The REPO contains 3 folders. (i) MAIN stores the python scripts divided in SOLIDS_ISO (the main program),PREPROCESOR.py(model input subroutines), ASSEMUTILS.py (assembly subroutines), FEMUTIL.py(general finite element method subroutines), UELUTIL.py (local matrix subroutines for different elements), POSTPROCESOR.py (results handling subroutines); (ii) MESHES contains input files and meshes in .msh format corresponding to different examples and (iii) MESHUTILS stores programs to conduct pre-processing and post-processing from and to GMESH. Since the code has been created for academic purposes it gives as main results the displacement vector corresponding to the nodal points of the domain. These vectors are used, together with the python function griddata to interpolate and plot the displacement solution all over the domain. Post-processing to compute strain and stress values is left for students projects.
